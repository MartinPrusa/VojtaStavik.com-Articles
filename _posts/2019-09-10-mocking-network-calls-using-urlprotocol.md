For many apps, networking code is one of the most important parts of the whole codebase. Yet it's also a part which is quite difficult to test properly.

Some people just give up and rely on thorough manual testing. This approach doesn't really scale well. A medium-sized app can have hundreds of various API requests. Having to test all of them manually makes any future changes and refactoring tedious and dangerous.

Another popular solution you can see in the wild is making real network calls, especially in integration and UI tests. *Not great, not terrible.* ‚ò¢Ô∏è Real network calls make tests simple but [slower by the order of several magnitudes](https://twitter.com/srigi/status/917998817051541504?s=20). It also makes them much less reliable. The success of the tests depends on your current networking conditions. *Ask yourself if it's OK that your tests fail when the train you're working from enters a tunnel.*

**Can we somehow keep the simplicity of real network calls while making it more reliable and network-conditions independent?**

### Custom `URLProtocol` Subclass to Help

`URLProtocol` subclasses is what iOS uses to figure out the loading behavior for specific URLs and schemes. By default, Apple provides these protocols: `_NSURLHTTPProtocol`, `_NSURLDataProtocol`, `_NSURLFTPProtocol`, `_NSURLFileProtocol`, `NSAboutURLProtocol`.

By providing a custom protocol to the iOS URL loading system, we can intercept the networking communication and make sure *certain* URL requests are given a special treatment.

```swift
class MockResponseURLProtocol: URLProtocol {
  override class func canonicalRequest(for request: URLRequest) -> URLRequest {
    // Overriding this function is required by the superclass.
    return request
  }
}

// We need to register the custom URLProtocol so the URL
// loading system knows about it.
URLProtocol.registerClass(MockResponseURLProtocol.self)
```

To find out which `URLProtocol` to use, the system asks all registered `URLProtocol` classes whether they `canInit(with request: URLRequest)`. We don't want to intercept all network communication, so we're going to identify the requests we want to intercept by their URL and the simulated response:

```swift
class MockResponseURLProtocol: URLProtocol {

  /// The key-pairs of URLs this URLProtocol intercepts with
  /// their simulated response.
  static var mockResponses: [URL: Result<Data, Error>] = [:]

  override class func canInit(with request: URLRequest) -> Bool {
    guard let url = request.url else { return false }
    return mockResponses.keys.contains(url)
  }

  { ... }
}
```

### Simulate Receiving Data

The next thing we need to do is to provide the implementation for the `startLoading()` method. We check for the mock response we're suppose to provide and then call the appropriate methods on `self.client`. The client's type is `URLProtocolClient` and it's the way `URLProtocol` communicates with the URL loading system.

```swift
class MockResponseURLProtocol: URLProtocol {

  { ... }

  override func startLoading() {
    guard let response = MockResponseURLProtocol.mockResponses[self.request.url!] else {
      fatalError("""
        No mock response for \(request.url!). This should never happen. Check
        the implementation of `canInit(with request: URLRequest) -> Bool`.
        """)
    }

    // Simulate the response on a background thread.
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default).async {
      switch response {
      case let .success(data):
        // Simulate received data.
        self.client?.urlProtocol(self, didLoad: data)

        // Finish loading (required).
        self.client?.urlProtocolDidFinishLoading(self)

      case let .failure(error):
        // Simulate error.
        self.client?.urlProtocol(self, didFailWithError: error)
      }
    }
  }

  override func stopLoading() {
    // Required by the superclass.
  }
}
```

### Setting Up the Mock Response

Here's the complete Playground page showcasing all code needed to mock a network response:

```swift
import Foundation

/// The URLProtocol subclass allowing to intercept the network communication
/// and provide custom mock responses for the given URLs.
class MockResponseURLProtocol: URLProtocol {

  /// The key-pairs of URLs this URLProtocol intercepts with their simulated response.
  static var mockResponses: [URL: Result<Data, Error>] = [:]

  override class func canInit(with request: URLRequest) -> Bool {
    guard let url = request.url else { return false }
    return mockResponses.keys.contains(url)
  }

  override class func canonicalRequest(for request: URLRequest) -> URLRequest {
    // Overriding this function is required by the superclass.
    return request
  }

  override func startLoading() {
    guard let response = MockResponseURLProtocol.mockResponses[self.request.url!] else {
      fatalError("""
        No mock response for \(request.url!). This should never happen. Check
        the implementation of `canInit(with request: URLRequest) -> Bool`.
        """)
    }

    // Simulate response on a background thread.
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default).async {
      switch response {
      case let .success(data):
        // Simulate received data.
        self.client?.urlProtocol(self, didLoad: data)

        // Finish loading (required).
        self.client?.urlProtocolDidFinishLoading(self)

      case let .failure(error):
        // Simulate error.
        self.client?.urlProtocol(self, didFailWithError: error)
      }
    }
  }

  override func stopLoading() {
    // Required by the superclass.
  }
}

// We need to register the custom URLProtocol so the URL loading system knows about it.
URLProtocol.registerClass(MockResponseURLProtocol.self)

// The URL we want to load
let url = URL(string: "industrial-binaries.co")!

// Define the mock response
MockResponseURLProtocol.mockResponses[url] = .success(Data(repeating: 0, count: 2000))

// Load data
let data = try! Data(contentsOf: url)

// Check the data is correct
assert(data.count == 2000) // All good üëç
```

### Downloading Progress Simulation

Let's try something more complex. By adding just a couple of lines of code we can easily simulate progressive downloading:

```swift
class MockResponseURLProtocol: URLProtocol {

  { ... }

  override func startLoading() {
    guard let response = MockResponseURLProtocol.mockResponses[self.request.url!] else {
      fatalError("""
        No mock response for \(request.url!). This should never happen. Check
        the implementation of `canInit(with request: URLRequest) -> Bool`.
        """)
    }

    // Simulate response on a background thread.
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default).async {
      switch response {
      case let .success(data):

        // Step 1: Simulate receiving an URLResponse. We need to do this
        // to let the client know the expected length of the data.
        let response = URLResponse(
          url: self.request.url!,
          mimeType: nil,
          expectedContentLength: data.count,
          textEncodingName: nil
        )

        self.client?.urlProtocol(self, didReceive: response, cacheStoragePolicy: .notAllowed)

        // Step 2: Split data into chunks
        let chunkSize = 10
        let chunks = stride(from: 0, to: data.count, by: chunkSize).map {
          data[$0 ..< min($0 + chunkSize, data.count)]
        }

        // Step 3: Simulate received data chunk by chunk.
        for chunk in chunks {
          self.client?.urlProtocol(self, didLoad: chunk)
        }

        // Step 4: Finish loading (required).
        self.client?.urlProtocolDidFinishLoading(self)

      case let .failure(error):
        // Simulate error.
        self.client?.urlProtocol(self, didFailWithError: error)
      }
    }
  }

  { ... }

}
```

We're going to use `URLSession`to test the progress simulation:

```swift
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { _, _, _ in
  print("Done!")
}

let observation = task.progress
  .observe(\.fractionCompleted) { progress, _ in
    print(progress.fractionCompleted, terminator: " ")
  }
```

Looks good! üëç

### Ideas
- You can introduce an artificial delay and send the data chunks to the client gradually. It's a great way to simulate bad network conditions.
- The mocked responses don't have to identified only by their `URL`. You can also check `URLRequest`'s body, HTTP method and other parameters. The response can even be dynamic based on the request's content!
- You can prepare mock responses for all main API points your app uses. It's a great way to make sure the app has stable conditions for UI testing.
