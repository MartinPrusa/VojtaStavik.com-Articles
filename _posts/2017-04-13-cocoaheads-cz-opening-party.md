The CocoaHeadsCZ opening party happened on 6.4.2017 and we had a lot of fun!

We met at a lovely place called Bistro Arte. We managed to discuss a lot of important things for the future of CocoaHeads in Prague, and also had a couple of beers.

#### We agreed on the following:
- We'd like to have meet-ups monthly and we're going to follow the recommended time, second Thursday of the month.

- We are not big fans of the classic meet-up scheme with talks and presentations. There are already meet-ups like this happening in Prague and their quality is really good. We'd like to explore new possibilities and make our meet-ups more interactive.

- The next meet-up will be on ~~11.5.2017~~ 15.6.2017 and it's going to be a micro hackathon (ÂµHackathon)! We will have 3-4 hours and we are all together going to try to create and finish one single app. Attendees will be divided into several ÂµTeams and each team will be working on a small part of the app.

Don't forget to follow [@CocoaHeadsCZ](https://twitter.com/CocoaHeadsCZ) and see you all ~~11.5.2017~~ 15.6.2017!
