I decided to try something new and recorded a YouTube video. This is the first video of the iOS Code Review series I'd like to do. In this series I'm going to review iOS projects which you can submit using [this form](https://vojtastavik.typeform.com/to/Y5p1BU).

I'll remove all traces of the author or name of the project from the codebase. I'd like to focus solely on the code and show how to improve problematic parts.

Submit a project to the next iOS code review using [https://vojtastavik.typeform.com/to/Y5p1BU](https://vojtastavik.typeform.com/to/Y5p1BU).
